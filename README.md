# Bootstrap

I made made three html files of My portfolio:
index.html
contact.html
portfolio.html

Also I made css file to adjust some containers and photos

First page (index)start with  navbar and header, which is followed by the container with columns and rows, with text and the photo in it. I also set background photo which I styled in seperate css fyle.
At the end comes the stycky footer which I seperated from the column so if would not be attached to it.

Second page (Contact) starts the same way as the previous one and is also followed by the container with forms and submit button in it which I also made with Bootstrap codes.And at the end comes the same stycky footer.

Third page (portfolio) has images with the titles which is inside of the container.I made the Bootstrap cards for that and attached the images from css file.
