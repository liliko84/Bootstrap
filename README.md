# Bootstrap

I made made three html files of My portfolio:
index.html
contact.html
portfolio.html

Also I made css file to adjust some containers and photos

First page (index)start with  navbar and header, which is followed by the container with columns and rows, with text and the photo in it. above the photo is about me which I gave clas of 12 col, and my image took 3 and the rest 9 I used for the text. I also set background photo which I styled in seperate css fyle.
At the end comes the stycky footer which I seperated from the column so if would not be attached to it.It was also styled in css fyle.

Second page (Contact) starts the same way as the previous one and is also followed by the container with forms and submit button in it which I also made with Bootstrap codes.The differenc from firts page are the forms which mainly took 5 columns, And at the end comes the same stycky footer.

Third page (portfolio) has images with the titles which is inside of the container , made the flexrow and put the Bootstrap cards in it attached with images which I adjusted in css file. Made the text at the end of the image with background color and text color styled in css.
